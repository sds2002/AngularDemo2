1. What is “state” in this app?

Think of state as the single source of truth for your todos.

Initially: your todo list is empty ([]).

Whenever you add, toggle, or delete a todo, you update this state.

All components that care about todos react automatically to the changes.

2. The BehaviorSubject

In todo.service.ts:

private todosSubject: BehaviorSubject<Todo[]> = new BehaviorSubject<Todo[]>([]);
todos$: Observable<Todo[]> = this.todosSubject.asObservable();


BehaviorSubject → like a box that holds your state and notifies anyone who’s watching when it changes.

todos$ → is the Observable we give to components. Components subscribe to it, so they see changes automatically.

Analogy: Imagine a whiteboard in a room:

BehaviorSubject → the whiteboard itself (holds the latest info).

Observable → the people in the room watching the whiteboard.

next() → writing something new on the whiteboard.

3. Updating State

When you add a todo:

addTodo(title: string) {
  const newTodo: Todo = { id: Date.now(), title, completed: false };
  this.todosSubject.next([...this.todos, newTodo]);
}


this.todos → gets the current list of todos.

next([...this.todos, newTodo]) → creates a new list including the new todo and pushes it to everyone watching (todos$).

This is reactive programming: changes in state automatically flow to the UI.

4. The Component

In todo-list.component.ts:

todos$: Observable<Todo[]>; // Observable from service
this.todos$ = this.todoService.todos$;


The component doesn’t hold its own todo list. It just listens to todos$.

Whenever the service updates the list, the component updates automatically.

In template:

<li *ngFor="let todo of todos$ | async">


| async → subscribes to the Observable and updates the list in real time.

5. Why This is Powerful

Single source of truth → all components see the same state.

Reactive updates → no need to manually refresh or pass data around.

Scalable → for bigger apps, you can organize multiple state slices using this pattern.
