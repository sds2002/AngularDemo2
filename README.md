Here is a simple Angular example illustrating the use of ContentChild, along with an explanation. This example can be copied into a new Angular project to see ContentChild in action.

ContentChild is a decorator in Angular used to get a reference to a child component, directive, or element that is projected into a component using <ng-content>. It lets a component access content that is passed from a parent component into its template.
